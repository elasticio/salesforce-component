### API version
The component uses Salesforce - API Version 45.0, except:
- Deprecated Actions and Triggers - API Version 25.0

### Authentication
Authentication occurs via OAuth 2.0.
In the component repository you need to specify OAuth Client credentials as environment variables:
- ```OAUTH_CLIENT_ID``` - your OAuth client key
- ```OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET``` - your OAuth client secret

## Create new App in Salesforce

In order to make OAuth work, you need a new App in your Salesforce. During app creation process you will be asked to specify
the callback URL, to process OAuth authentication via elastic.io platform your callback URL should be

```https://your-tenant.elastic.io/callback/oauth2```

More information you can find [here](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=connected_app_create.htm)

## Credentials

During credentials creation you would need to:
- choose ``Environment``
- enter ``Username`` and ``Password`` in a pop-up window after click on ``Authenticate`` button.
- verify and save your new credentials.
### Limitations
According to [Salesforce documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_request_manage.htm&type=5)

`Each connected app allows five unique approvals per user. When a sixth approval is made, the oldest approval is revoked.`

You can get error `refresh token has been expired` if the same user account was authenticated with same OAuth Application (OAuth Client) more than 4 times. This is feature of the Salesforce platform that automatically invalidates the oldest refresh_token as soon as a number of given refresh tokens for an individual user account exceeds 4.

## Actions
### Query
Executing a SOQL Query that may return many objects. Each resulting object is emitted one-by-one. Use the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) to search your organization’s Salesforce data for specific information. SOQL is similar to the SELECT statement in the widely used Structured Query Language (SQL) but is designed specifically for Salesforce data. This action allows you to interact with your data using SOQL.
Empty object will be returned, if query doesn't find any data.

#### Input fields description
* **Include deleted** - checkbox, if checked - deleted records will be included into the result list.

#### Input fields description
* **Optional batch size** - A positive integer specifying batch size. If no batch size is specified then results of the query will be emitted one-by-one, otherwise, query results will be emitted in an array of maximum batch size.
* **Allow all results to be returned in a set** - checkbox which allows emitting query results in a single array. `Optional batch size` option is ignored in this case.
* **SOQL Query** - Input field where you should type the SOQL query. E.g. `"SELECT ID, Name from Contact where Name like 'John Smi%'"`

### Create Object
Creates a new Selected Object.
Action creates a single object. Input metadata is fetched dynamically from your Salesforce account. Output metadata is the same as input metadata, so you may expect all fields that you mapped as input to be returned as output.

Note:
In case of an **Attachment** object type you should specify `Body` in base64 encoding. `ParentId` is a Salesforce ID of an object (Account, Lead, Contact) which an attachment is going to be attached to.

#### Input fields description
* **Object** - Input field where you should choose the object type, which you want to find. E.g. `Account`
* **Utilize data attachment from previous step (for objects with a binary field)** - a checkbox, if it is checked and an input message contains an attachment and specified object has a binary field (type of base64) then the input data is put into object's binary field. In this case any data specified for the binary field in the data mapper is discarded.

This action will automatically retrieve all existing fields of chosen object type that available on your Salesforce organization

#### Limitations
When **Utilize data attachment from previous step (for objects with a binary field)** is checked and this action is used with Local Agent error would be thrown: 'getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND steward-service.platform.svc.cluster.local steward-service.platform.svc.cluster.local:8200'

### Delete Object
Deletes a Selected Object.

#### Input field description
* **Object** - Input field where you should choose the object type, which you want to delete. E.g. `Account`

#### Metadata description
* **id** - `string`, salesforce object id

Result is an object with 3 fields.
* **id** - `string`, salesforce object id
* **success** - `boolean`, if operation was successful `true`
* **errors** - `array`, if operation fails, it will contain description of errors

### Upsert Object
Creates or Updates Selected Object.
Action creates a single object. Input metadata is fetched dynamically from your Salesforce account. Output metadata is the same as input metadata, so you may expect all fields that you mapped as input to be returned as output.

#### Input field description
* **Object** - Input field where you should choose the object type, which you want to find. E.g. `Account`
* **Optional Upsert field** - Input field where you should specify the ExternalID name field. E.g. `ExtId__c`.
* **Utilize data attachment from previous step (for objects with a binary field)** - a checkbox, if it is checked and an input message contains an attachment and specified object has a binary field (type of base64) then the input data is put into object's binary field. In this case any data specified for the binary field in the data mapper is discarded.

You should specify **external** or **internal Id** for making some updates in salesforce object.
If you want to create new Object you should always specify **Optional Upsert field** and value of ExternalId in input body structure.

#### Limitations
When **Utilize data attachment from previous step (for objects with a binary field)** is checked and this action is used with Local Agent error would be thrown: 'getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND steward-service.platform.svc.cluster.local steward-service.platform.svc.cluster.local:8200'

### Lookup Object (at most 1)
Lookup an object by a selected field.
Action creates a single object. Input metadata is fetched dynamically from your Salesforce account. Output metadata is the same as input metadata, so you may expect all fields that you mapped as input to be returned as output.

#### Input field description
* **Object** - dropdown list where you should choose the object type, which you want to find. E.g. `Account`.
* **Type Of Search** -  dropdown list with two values: `Unique Fields` and `All Fields`.
* **Lookup by field** - dropdown list with all fields on the selected object, if on *Type Of Search* is chosen `All Fields`, or with all fields on the selected object where `type` is `id` or `unique` is `true` , if on *Type Of Search* is chosen `Unique Fields`.
* **Allow criteria to be omitted** - checkbox, if checked - search criteria can be omitted and the empty object will be returned, else - search criteria are required.
* **Allow zero results** - checkbox, if checked and nothing is found - empty object will be returned, else - action throw an error.
* **Pass binary data to the next component (if found object has it)** - a checkbox, if it is checked and found object has a binary field (type of base64) then its data will be passed to the next component as a binary attachment.

#### Metadata description

Metadata contains one field whose name, type and mandatoriness are generated according to the value of the configuration fields *Lookup by field* and *Allow criteria to be omitted*.

#### Limitations
When **Pass binary data to the next component (if found object has it)** is checked and this action is used with Local Agent error would be thrown: 'getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND steward-service.platform.svc.cluster.local steward-service.platform.svc.cluster.local:8200'

### Lookup Objects
Lookup a list of objects satisfying specified criteria.

#### Input field description
* **Object** - dropdown list where you should choose the object type, which you want to find. E.g. `Account`.
* **Include deleted** - checkbox, if checked - deleted records will be included into the result list.
* **Output method** - dropdown list with following values: "Emit all", "Emit page", "Emit individually".
* **Number of search terms** - text field where you can specify a number of search terms (not less than 0 and not greater than 42). Default value is 0 (if provided value is not allowed).

#### Metadata description

Depending on the the configuration field *Output method* the input metadata can contain different fields:
*Output method* - "Emit page":
Field "Page size" - optional positive integer that defaults to 1000;
Field "Page number" - required non-negative integer (starts with 0, default value 0);

*Output method* - "Emit all":
Field "Maximum number of records" - optional positive integer (default value 1000);

*Output method* - "Emit individually":
Field "Maximum number of records" - optional positive integer (default value 10000);

Note that the number of records the component emits may affect the performance of the platform/component.

Groups of fields for each search term go next:

Field "Field name" - string represents object's field (a list of allowed values is available);
Field "Field value" - string represents value for selected field;
Field "Condition" - one of the following: "=", "!=", "<", "<=", ">", ">=", "LIKE", "IN", "NOT IN";

Between each two term's group of fields:

Field "Logical operator" - one of the following: "AND", "OR";

Output data is an object, with a field "results" that is an array of objects.

### Bulk Create/Update/Delete
Bulk API provides a simple interface for quickly loading large amounts of data from CSV file into Salesforce (up to 10'000 records).
Action takes a CSV file from the attachment as an input. CSV file format is described in the [Salesforce documentatio](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_bulk_v2.meta/api_bulk_v2/datafiles.htm)

#### Input field description
* **Operation** - dropdown list with 3 supported operations: `Create`, `Update` and `Delete`.
* **Object** - dropdown list where you should choose the object type to perform bulk operation. E.g. `Case`.
* **Timeout** - maximum time to wait until the server completes a bulk operation (default: `600` sec).

Result is an object with a property **result**: `array`. It contains objects with 3 fields.
* **id** - `string`, salesforce object id
* **success** - `boolean`, if operation was successful `true`
* **errors** - `array`, if operation failed contains description of errors

#### Limitations
* No errors thrown in case of failed Object Create/Update/Delete (`"success": "false"`).
* Object ID is needed for Update and Delete.
* Salesforce processes up to 10'000 records from the input CSV file.


### Bulk Query
Fetches records to a CSV file.

#### Input field description
* **SOQL Query** - Input field where you should type the SOQL query. E.g. `"SELECT ID, Name from Contact where Name like 'John Smi%'"`

Result is a CSV file in the attachment.

* **Optional batch size** - A positive integer specifying batch size. If no batch size is specified then results of the query will be emitted one-by-one, otherwise, query results will be emitted in an array of maximum batch size.
* **Object** - Input field where you should choose the object type, which you want to find. E.g. `Account`
* **Lookup field** - Input field where you should choose the lookup field which you want to use for result filtering. E.g. `Id`.

```For now, you can specify all unique, lookup, ExternalID/Id fields. ```

##### Execution result handling
|Condition | Execution result |
|----------|------------------|
|Lookup failed - we were not able to find any parent object. |Lookup action emits a single message with an empty body.|
|Lookup found a single object, e.g. we were able to identify a parent Account to the Contact|A single message will be emitted, found object will be a body of the message|
|Lookup found multiple objects (that may happen when a lookup is made by non-unique field) | Each found object will be emitted with the separate message|

## Triggers
### Query
Continuously runs the same SOQL Query and emits results one-by-one.
Use the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) to search your organization’s Salesforce data for specific information. SOQL is similar to the SELECT statement in the widely used Structured Query Language (SQL) but is designed specifically for Salesforce data. This action allows you to interact with your data using SOQL.

#### List of Expected Config fields

* **SOQL Query** - Input field for your SOQL Query

### Get New and Updated Objects Polling
Polls existing and updated objects. You can select any custom or built-in object for your Salesforce instance.

#### Input field description
* **Object** - Input field where you should select the type of object which updates you want to get. E.g. `Account`;
* **Start Time** - Indicates the beginning time to start polling from. Defaults to `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`;
* **End Time** - If provided, don’t fetch records modified after this time;
* **Size of Polling Page** - Indicates the size of pages to be fetched. You can set positive integer, max `10 000`, defaults to `1000`;
* **Process single page per execution** - You can select on of options (defaults to `yes`):
   1. `yes` - if the number of changed records exceeds the maximum number of results in a page, wait until the next flow start to fetch the next page;
   2. `no` - if the number of changed records exceeds the maximum number of results in a page, the next pages will fetching in the same execution.

For example, you have 234 “Contact” objects, 213 of them were changed from 2019-01-01.
You want to select all “Contacts” that were changed from 2019-01-01, set the page size to 100 and process single page per execution.
For you purpose you need to specify following fields:
   * Object: `Contact`
   * Start Time: `2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`
   * Size of Polling Page: `100`
   * Process single page per execution: `yes` (or leave this empty)

As a result, all contacts will be fetched in three calls of the trigger: two of them by 100 items, and the last one by 13.
If you select `no` in **Process single page per execution**, all 213 contacts will be fetched in one call of the trigger.

### Subscribe to platform events (REALTIME FLOWS ONLY)
This trigger will subscribe for any platform Event using Salesforce streaming API.

#### Input field description
* **Event object name** - Input field where you should select the type of platform event which you want to subscribe E.g. `My platform event`
